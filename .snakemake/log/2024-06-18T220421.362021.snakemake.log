        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job intersect since they might be corrupted:
intermediate_files/indexed_IAD143293_241_Designed.bed, intermediate_files/intersect_genes_IAD143293_241_Designed.bed
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
