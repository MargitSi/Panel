MissingOutputException in rule nontarget in file /tank/projects/margarita/Panel/Final/Snakefile, line 24:
Job 3  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
intermediate_files/DB (missing locally, parent dir contents: DB.nhr, panel_IAD143293_241_Designed.fa, DB.nin, blast_results_IAD143293_241_Designed.txt, DB.nsq)
Removing output files of failed job nontarget since they might be corrupted:
intermediate_files/panel_IAD143293_241_Designed.fa, intermediate_files/blast_results_IAD143293_241_Designed.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
